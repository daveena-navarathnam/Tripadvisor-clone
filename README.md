🧠 Project Overview

This project replicates the core layout and visual structure of the Tripadvisor homepage, including:

Responsive navigation bar

Category-based search navigation

Adaptive layouts for tablet and mobile screens

The primary goal was to practice real-world layout building and responsive UI behavior using only HTML and CSS (no frameworks).


🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend

HTML5 (Semantic Structure)

CSS3

Flexbox

Media Queries

Assets & Tools

Google Fonts (Poppins)

Font Awesome Icons

Git & GitHub

📱 Responsive Strategy

The layout adapts using a desktop-first approach with breakpoints at:

Responsive improvements include:

Navigation collapsing into icons

Card layouts stacking vertically

Search button behavior adapting for mobile

Image resizing with aspect-ratio and object-fit

Flexible containers using flex-wrap

Controlled width using max-width containers


🏗️ Architecture & Layout Decisions

Used reusable card structures for explore, inspiration, and whale sections

Implemented centralized container widths (max-width) for consistent alignment

Used Flexbox for layout control instead of Grid to strengthen Flexbox mastery

Maintained semantic section grouping for better structure and readability

Structured CSS logically by component blocks
